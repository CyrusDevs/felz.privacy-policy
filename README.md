# Felz Privacy Policy

Last updated and effective: October 21, 2022

This privacy policy applies to the Discord bot Felz#3328.

---

> By default, Felz does not store any data. If a server member with the Manage Server permission uses the `setprefix` command to change the bot's prefix, then the server's automatically-generated Discord ID (for example, `398998849026261003`) will be stored in the bot's database along with the provided prefix. No other data relating to the server is stored. Felz never stores data specific to users.

The prefix data is stored only for the bot to function and is not shared with anyone else or used for any other reason. The data is stored on Database.

To contact me ([Fahmi]()), the developer of AdvaithBot, if you want the data to be removed or for any other reason, you can mention Fahmi#4167 (`190916650143318016`) in the official [AdvaithBot Discord server](https://discord.gg/SztAXAh).

Also see [Discord's Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy).

Thanks for using AdvaithBot!
